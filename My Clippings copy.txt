Any sort of invader that is able to give your immune system a run for its money is called a Pathogen—which appropriately means “the maker of suffering.” So every microorganism that causes disease is a pathogen, no matter what species, no matter how big or small. And almost everything can become a pathogen under the right circumstances. For example, a regular old bacteria living on your skin might not bother you at all, but can become a pathogen if you are going through chemotherapy and are immunocompromised, making it easy to invade you. So whenever you read “pathogen,” just remember it means “a thing that makes you sick.”

People who don’t have enough T Cells, because of a genetic defect, chemotherapy, or a disease like AIDS, have a very high chance of dying from infections and cancers. Sadly, even with the best our modern medicine has to offer, the lives of patients without T Cells often can’t be saved.
